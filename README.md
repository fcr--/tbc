![tbc_logo](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/963345828/78ea40a2-977c-4de4-b24d-74d9f3cef4c6)

A simple and powerful command-line client for TeraBox, written in Go.
It supports `ls`-like file listing, memory-efficient split upload/download, and an interactive mode (REPL).

## ✨ Features

- **Unix-like Experience**: Familiar commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`.
- **Rich Display**: `ls` command supports ANSI colors and grid display, automatically adjusting to terminal width.
- **Memory Efficient**: Implements streaming processing to minimize memory usage even during large file uploads/downloads.
- **Interactive Mode**: Enter REPL mode by running without arguments to execute commands continuously.
- **Progress Bar**: Visual progress bar for transfers.
